# svelte firstapp
My first app using svelte. This looks interesting at the first site 



 [Use degit](https://svelte.dev/blog/the-easiest-way-to-get-started) 
 
When you download from the REPL, you're getting a customised version of the  repo. You can skip messing around with zip files by using , a project scaffolding tool.

In the terminal, you can instantly create a new project like so:

npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-project
cd my-svelte-project
npm install
npm run dev
